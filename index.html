      <left><h1> Information: I`m a student of the Higher School of Economic and I`m being proud of it. I hate informatics with all my heart (cause I`m really bad at it and I cannot change the situation). However I`m sure that IT is the most perspective sci-field today, plus Bill Ghates - the founder of Microsoft is the iconic figure for me - I really appreciate him, his projects and more than anything his super progressive ideas regarding politics, bissiness, education etc .</h1></left>
